1 maximum summation .. minimum summation .. for a list 

      thinking would be :

 
                  first  get the summations of all list 

                  secondly : get the minimum & maximum elements by comparsions ..not by built in max & min 

                  third : the maximum summation: summation - minimum 
                   4th: the minimum summation: summation - maximum 

      don't forget .. initialize the first item of the list .. and then comparsions
