2 ) to calculate how many times the maximum element occurs 

       
           first : we have to calculate the max element 

                 initialze the first of the list 
                 then loop throught the list 
                 if the i element > or equal to the initial value 
                     then put max = arr[i]

           till here we get the maximum element 


            second : loop through the list again .. to calcalute how many times 
                      if the arr[i] == maximum 
                         put count +=1 

     return count
