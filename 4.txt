''' a problem consists of a  binary list .. you have to sort it .. zeros first.. .then ones 


  and you  need to print all zeros you find ,, in this array ..'''


''' first count the zeros .. 
put them in the biginnnig of the array ...
then looop from the rest index .. to the last of the array .. 
to put ones in them '''





second solution .. 


to use the pivot .. as 1 

and loop throught the list .. 

if the currnet element smaller than pivot .. 

sawp this element with the first index "j " 

and increases "j"


                   and the SWAP 

 is a function
