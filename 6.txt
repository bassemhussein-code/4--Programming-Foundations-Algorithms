Find the maximum product of two integers in an array ..\



the first solution .. is to loop throught the array twice..
and every time update the variable with  the product                              O(n*2 )



the second solution .. is to sort the array .. 

you don't know which is bigger .. first elements .. or .. the last elements 
 
so you check .. if                                                                O(nlog (n))



the third solution .. is to solve this problem in a linear time ..            O(n ) 


looop through the list ... and comparsionsn in the first min && second min .. the first max .. && the second min
